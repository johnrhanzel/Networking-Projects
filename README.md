 The startup company Project RedLine purchased an IP address for the usage of the company’s network connection. As a network engineer, I was assigned to create a proposal wherein all networks should share data, and all should be connected to the Internet.

In this proposal, there are four (4) main departments in Project RedLine company which are: IT Department, Design Department, Marketing Department, and Accounting Department.
